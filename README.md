# IBM-Quantum-Challenge-2020
During the three-week challenge, participants learned how to implement complex quantum data structures using qRAM and design a quantum game solver using Grover’s algorithm. The combination of qRAM and Grover’s algorithm has many practical applications in solving real-life problems on our future quantum systems in areas of quantum machine learning and complex decision making problems.

Participants were presented with a new set of exercises each Monday during the challenge, which became progressively more difficult each week.
